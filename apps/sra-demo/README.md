# ZeroDev Smart Routing Address Demo

A playground for the `@zerodev/smart-routing-address-react-ui` widget. Runs
in two modes:

- **Simulated** — every SRA server call is intercepted by an
  in-memory mock, so you can exercise the full deposit lifecycle (routing,
  fees, past deposits, error states) without any real network, funds, or
  project ID. The banner and controls make this mode explicit.
- **Mainnet** — the widget speaks to the live
  SRA server. Real deposit addresses, real routing, real funds. The mode
  toggle is persisted in `localStorage` and the recipient is cleared as a
  safety default so you can't accidentally send funds to a stale address.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

You'll need a [ZeroDev](https://dashboard.zerodev.app) account for a project
ID if you plan to use Mainnet mode.
